\subsection{No Hang Up}

Commands that run in the foreground can be run in the background by
using a combination of the \texttt{nohup} command and the shell's job
control facilities. An example of starting the space rocket in the
background is shown in code listing \ref{code:jobrun}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:jobrun,caption=Starting the space rocket in the background]
$ cd ~/local/space-rocket-1.0.3
$ nohup ./bin/start.sh &
[1] 2522
nohup: ignoring input and appending output to ‘nohup.out’
\end{lstlisting}

Standard output is now redirected to the \texttt{nohup.out} file and the
process is running with id 2552 and job id 1. This means that you can
later stop the process as shown in code listing \ref{code:jobkill}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:jobkill,caption=Stopping the space rocket]
$ kill %1
[1]+  Terminated              nohup ./bin/start.sh
\end{lstlisting}

To get a listing of the jobs running in the background, please run the
commands in code listing \ref{code:joblist}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:joblist,caption=Listing the jobs running in the background]
$ jobs
[1]+  Running                 nohup ./bin/start.sh &
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Console Window Managers}

Console window managers are software that allow multiple virtual
terminals to be run on the same console. They also allow detaching from
the console and reattaching at a later time. Examples of such software
are
screen\footnote{\href{http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/}{\texttt{http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/}}}
and
tmux\footnote{\href{http://tmux.sourceforge.net/}{\texttt{http://tmux.sourceforge.net/}}}.

Ubuntu has a convenient wrapper for console window managers called
byobu\footnote{\href{http://byobu.co/}{\texttt{http://byobu.co/}}}.

We recommend getting familiar with a console window manager of your
choice instead of relying on \texttt{nohup}.

An excellent, simple, short tutorial on using byobu can be found in the
online Ubuntu Community
Help\footnote{\href{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Byobu}{\texttt{https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Byobu}}}.
