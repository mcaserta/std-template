\section{Building}

Software modules need to be built in the same order as they appear in
this document.

In this section we assume a \texttt{\$HOME/build} directory has been
created and all build work, including checking out the source code, will
be performed in this directory.

We also assume that if the build tool execution exits with a successful
exit code\footnote{Apache Maven is very explicit with regard to its exit
code, printing the final build status at the end of its processing work,
i.e. it will print an explicit \textit{success} string} and a
\texttt{target} directory was created in the process, then the build was
successful and all artifacts were created correctly. 

\subsection{Space Rocket}
\subsubsection{Getting the source code}

Please run the commands in code listing \ref{code:buildspacerocketclone}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:buildspacerocketclone,caption=Cloning the
\texttt{space-rocket} module]
$ cd $HOME/build
$ git clone http://scm.acme.com/git/space-rocket
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Checking out a given version}

Software versions are represented in the git repository as tags. Please
follow the example in code listing \ref{code:buildspacerocketcheckout}
to list the available tags and checkout a given version.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:buildspacerocketcheckout,caption=Listing
version tags and checking out one in the \texttt{space-rocket} module]
$ cd $HOME/build/space-rocket
$ git tag
v1.0.2
v1.0.3
$ git checkout v1.0.3
Note: checking out 'v1.0.3'.
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Build}
\label{sec:buildspacerocketbuild}

To build the software module, please run the commands in code listing
\ref{code:buildspacerocketbuild}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:buildspacerocketbuild,caption=Building the
\texttt{space-rocket} software module]
$ cd $HOME/build/space-rocket
$ mvn clean install
\end{lstlisting}
