\subsection{Space Rocket}

\subsubsection{Installation}

Make sure you've previously followed the build steps in
\ref{sec:buildspacerocketbuild}.

Assuming you've previously built version 1.0.3, to package the
spacerocket into a tarball for copying over to a remote machine, please
run the commands in code listing
\ref{code:spacerocketinstallpacktarball}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:spacerocketinstallpacktarball,caption=Preparing
the space rocket's distribution tarball]
$ cd ~/build/space-rocket/target
$ tar cvjf ~/dist/space-rocket-1.0.3.tar.bz2 space-rocket-1.0.3
\end{lstlisting}

At this point you must copy the distribution tarball to the target
machine in the \texttt{\$HOME/dist} directory.

Once on the target machine, to unpack the tarball and to verify its
contents, please run the commands in code listing
\ref{code:spacerocketinstallunpacktarball}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:spacerocketinstallunpacktarball,caption=Unpacking
the space rocket's distribution tarball]
$ tar xj -C ~/local -f ~/dist/space-rocket-1.0.3.tar.bz2
$ ls ~/local/space-rocket-1.0.3
bin  config  deploy  lib
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Configuration}

To configure logging for the space rocket, please refer to
\ref{sec:logging}.

\subsubsection{Running}

To start the space rocket, please run the commands in code listing
\ref{code:spacerocketinstallrun}.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:spacerocketinstallrun,caption=Starting the
space rocket]
$ cd ~/local/space-rocket-1.0.3
$ ./bin/start

\end{lstlisting}

The space rocket runs in the foreground. To detach from the running
process, please refer to \ref{sec:running}.
